# Data download
The version of news data used for our analysis is from [this Kaggle source](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/all-the-news).

Download the 3 CSV files and concatenate them using the script ```concat.py```. Place the resulting file
```all_the_news.csv``` in this directory so that it can be called by the analysis routines.
